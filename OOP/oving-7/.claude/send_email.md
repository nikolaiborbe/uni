# Send Email to Nikolai

Email Nikolai when a long task finishes, you hit a blocker requiring human input, or something unexpected happens.

## Command

```bash
curl -d "Your message here" "ntfy.sh/nikolai-arlerts-abc123?email=nikolaiborbe@gmail.com"
```

## Rules

- Keep messages short and clear
- Include enough context for Nikolai to act on it
